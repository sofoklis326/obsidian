loss of the mismatched HLA in the genome of the leukemia
epresents an important immune-escape mechanism that allows the leukemia to relapse after allo-HCT.
Genomic loss of mismatched HLA occurs through a mechanism of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity
eliminating the incompatible HLA alleles
without decreasing the overall level of expression of HLA class I molecules.
This explains why an NK-cell–mediated response is not activated.
Several studies have investigated the incidence of HLA loss after haploidentical allo-HCT
reporting that it can account for up to one-third of relapses in this setting
irrespective of the strategy used to control T-cell alloreactivity and prevent GVHD.

approaches to counteract the cooperation of oncogene-driven proliferation and immune escape is provided by the combined inhibition of the driving signaling pathway and immunotherapy tested in FLT3-ITD mutant AML relapsing after allo-HCT.

409 patients
relapsing
FLT3-ITD AML after allo-HCT suggested that relapse treatment with sorafenib and DLI was superior to DLI alone.
sorafenib may enhance immunogenicity of leukemia cells via induction of IL-15 production by the leukemia cells, thus enhancing T-cell activation.
The immunological effects were also seen when midostaurin or crenolanib were used instead of sorafenib.
FLT3-ITD is associated with activating transcription factor 4 induction, which inhibits IL-15 production.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitor–based inhibition of activating transcription factor 4 reverts this and allows for IL-15 production.
Therapeutic approaches that aim at activating the allogeneic immune response involve immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide or panobinostat.
Clinical case studies reported that treatment with lenalidomide can eliminate leukemia cells in relapsed AML after allo-HCT

The overall response rate in these patients was 32% including 23% complete remissions (CRs), and CR occurred in 4 patients with extramedullary AML.
Responses were long-lasting as 4 patients had a durable response for over 1 year. GVHD was reported in 14% and overall immune-related side effects were reported in 21% of the patients.
Tissue analysis showed that cytotoxic CD81 T-cell numbers were increased in responders whereas Tregs decreased.
anti-PD1 immunotherapy was given to patients relapsing with AML after allo-HCT
studies using higher anti-PD-1 dosages and including different hematological malignancies reported severe acute and chronic GVHD rates up to 55%
Further studies on the use of ipilimumab or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in AML/MDS relapse after allo-HCT are currently ongoing to determine the value of this approach to overcome immune escape post allo-HCT.
Cellular therapy in the form of preemptive DLI was reported in retrospective analyses showing efficacy to prevent hematological relapse.
One prospective study and several retrospective studies reported a response of overt AML/MDS relapse to therapeutic DLI.
Several studies suggest that DLIs in the setting of molecular or cytogenetic relapse, that is, preemptive DLI results in a higher response rate than DLI for overt relapse.
Other studies have analyzed the combination of DLI with chemotherapy71 or DLI and hypomethylating agents.
activity of azacytidine in 181 patients who relapsed after an allograft for AML (n 5 116) or MDSs (n 5 65) showed that the concurrent administration of DLI did not improve either response rates or overall survival in patients treated with azacytidine.
phase 1 study
AML relapse
chemotherapy followed by DLI followed by azacytidine showed clinical benefit in a fraction of patients.
This approach may help overcome immune escape because inhibition of DNA methylation can activate endogenous retroviral expression and double stranded RNA in cancer cells.
These retroviruses then cause stimulation of Toll-like receptor signaling, which induces an antiviral interferon response that enhances antitumor immunity.
supported
in vitro studies
reporting that cancer/ testis antigens were increasingly expressed in AML cell lines treated with 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine.
A prospective preemptive phase 2 study showed that treatment with 5-azacytidine in patients with a decrease of the CD34 donor chimerism or an increase of minimal residual disease (MRD) induced an increase of the donor chimerism or a decline of MRD, respectively.
The efficacy of the combination of azacytidine and DLI for hematological relapse after allo-HCT has been shown
These therapies can induce long-lasting remissions in a fraction of the patients who relapse after allo-HCT
an overall response rate of 33% including 27% CRs and the overall survival at 2 years was 29%.
intensive chemotherapy yielded better overall survival and progressionfree survival than hypomethylating agents when combined with DLI.

**Relapse in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation**

**Major Causes of Death:**

1. Relapse is the major cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for acute leukemias.
2. Infections and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are also significant causes of mortality.

**Factors Contributing to Relapse:**

1. **Resistance to Chemotherapy:** Limited ability of leukemia cells to respond to chemotherapy, leading to relapse.
2. **Escape from Immune Control:** Leukemia cells evade the immune system's control, allowing them to relapse.
3. **Immune Evasion Mechanisms:** Leukemia cells develop mechanisms to evade the immune response, such as downregulation of HLA class II molecules and production of anti-inflammatory factors.

**Mechanisms of Immune Evasion:**

1. **T-cell Recognition:** Leukemia cells recognize immunogenic peptides presented by self-HLA molecules and structural epitopes of non-selfHLAs.
2. **NK Cell Activation:** NK cells are activated in response to the absence or downregulation of self-HLA class I molecules.
3. **HLA Loss:** Loss of mismatched HLA alleles allows leukemia cells to escape immune control.

**Consequences of Immune Evasion:**

1. **Loss of T-cell Recognition:** Leukemia cells evade recognition by T-cells, leading to relapse.
2. **Production of Anti-inflammatory Factors:** Leukemia cells produce anti-inflammatory factors that suppress T-cell function and promote tumor growth.
3. **Release of Metabolically Active Enzymes:** Leukemia cells release metabolically active enzymes that contribute to immune evasion.

**Current Therapeutic Strategies:**

1. **Immunosuppressive Therapy:** Use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as lenalidomide and panobinostat, to enhance T-cell activation.
2. **Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody Treatment:** Use of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, such as ipilimumab, to block inhibitory immune checkpoints on AML cells.
3. **Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI):** Use of DLI to reinvigorate the donor's immune system and eliminate leukemia cells.

**Future Directions:**

1. **Immunotherapy:** Development of immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, to overcome immune evasion mechanisms.
2. **Combination Therapies:** Combination of immunosuppressive drugs with DLI or other therapies to enhance antitumor immunity.
3. **Personalized Medicine:** Development of personalized treatment strategies based on the genetic characteristics of individual patients.

**Key Findings:**

1. Relapse is a major cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for AML.
2. Immune evasion mechanisms, such as HLA loss and anti-inflammatory factor production, contribute to relapse.
3. Current therapeutic strategies, including immunosuppressive therapy and anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment, have shown promise in overcoming immune evasion mechanisms.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Immunotherapy:** Consider immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy, for patients with relapsed AML.
2. **Combination Therapies:** Combine immunosuppressive drugs with DLI or other therapies to enhance antitumor immunity.
3. **Personalized Medicine:** Develop personalized treatment strategies based on the genetic characteristics of individual patients.




**Mechanisms of Immune Escape after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation**

### Introduction

Relapse of the original disease is a major cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for acute leukemias. The mechanisms of immune escape can involve impaired leukemia cell recognition, immunosuppression by immune-checkpoint ligand expression, production of anti-inflammatory factors, release of metabolically active enzymes, loss of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and acquisition of novel driver mutations that promote leukemia outgrowth.

### Mechanisms of Immune Escape

#### 1. Impaired Leukemia Cell Recognition
* Loss of HLA genes
* Abrogation of leukemia cell recognition due to impaired Ag/HLA presentation machinery

#### 2. Upregulation of Immune-Checkpoint Molecules
* Programmed death 1 (PD-1)
* B7-H3 and other immune-regulatory molecules on AML cells at relapse post allo-HCT

#### 3. Increased Anti-Inflammatory Cytokine Production
* Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
* Reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-15 and G-CSF

#### 4. Immunosuppressive Enzymes
* Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1)
* Arginase
* CD39

#### 5. Acquisition of Novel Oncogenic Mutations and Loss of Tumor-Suppressor Genes
* Frequent changes in the genomic asset, including appearance at relapse of new mutations in TET2, WT1, and RAS

### Selected Therapeutic Strategies Against Immune Escape

* FLT3-ITD mutant AML relapse: combined inhibition of the driving signaling pathway and immunotherapy with sorafenib
* Lenalidomide or panobinostat for immunomodulatory effects
* Blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints on AML cells, such as CTLA-4
* Preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to prevent hematological relapse

### Future Directions

* Prospective trial on defined high-risk AML patient cohort to better understand the biology of relapse
* Analysis of the 6 main areas of immune escape in Figure 1
