Here is a concise summary of the key points:

* A new "substantially updated diffusion-based architecture" has been developed for predicting complex protein-ligand interactions.
* This architecture achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art docking tools, and even surpasses AlphaFold-Multimer v.2.37 in antibody-antigen prediction accuracy.
* The framework can model high-accuracy predictions across biomolecular space within a single unified deep-learning approach.
