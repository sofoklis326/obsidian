### Briefing Document: Cancer Immunotherapy - A T Cell Centric View

**Source:** Excerpts from "A guide to cancer immunotherapy: from T cell basic science to clinical practice" by Waldman, Fritz, and Lenardo.

**Executive Summary:**

This document reviews the historical development and current landscape of cancer immunotherapy, with a particular focus on the role of T cells. It traces the evolution of immunotherapy from early, less rigorous attempts to stimulate the immune system (e.g., Coley's toxins) to the modern era of checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell therapies (ACT), and cancer vaccines. The document emphasises the importance of T-cell regulation in cancer immunotherapy and provides an overview of clinically relevant immunotherapeutic strategies, their efficacy, associated toxicities, and emerging targets.

**Key Themes and Ideas:**

- **Historical Perspective:** The idea of using the immune system to fight cancer dates back to the 19th century, with observations of tumour regression following infection. William Coley's work using "Coley's toxins" represented an early attempt at immunotherapy, though it lacked scientific rigour. "With hopes of prospectively verifying his epidemiological evi­ dence, Coley treated patients with cancer with extracts of heat­inactivated S. pyogenes and Serratia marcescens to boost immunity3. This extract, termed ‘Coley’s tox­ ins’, possessed potent immunostimulatory properties and achieved favourable responses in various cancers2."
- **Cancer Immunosurveillance:** The concept of cancer immunosurveillance, where the immune system constantly monitors and eliminates neoplastic cells, gained traction in the 20th century. "In 1909, Paul Ehrlich hypothesized that the human body constantly gen erates neoplastic cells that are eradicated by the immune sys tem3. Lewis Thomas and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet independently conceived the ‘cancer immuno­ surveillance’ hypothesis, stating that tumour­associated neoantigens are recognized and targeted by the immune system to prevent carcinogenesis in a manner similar to graft rejection1."
- **Central Role of T Cells:** T cells, especially their cytotoxic function, are now considered central to cancer immunotherapy. "The T lymphocyte, especially its capacity for antigen-directed cytotoxicity, has become a central focus for engaging the immune system in the fight against cancer." Specifically, CD8+ T cells are known to carry out direct cytotoxic reactions to kill infected or neoplastic cells. In contrast, CD4+ T cells orchestrate the adaptive immune system.
- **Immune Checkpoints:** Immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, are crucial regulators of T-cell activation, preventing hyperactivation and autoimmunity. These checkpoints, however, can be co-opted by tumours to evade immune destruction. "Inhibitory molecules, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte­associated protein 4 (CTlA4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1), are induced during immune responses and represent a ‘checkpoint’ to dampen T cell hyperactivation281"
- **CTLA-4:** CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, binds to B7-1/B7-2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), preventing CD28 co-stimulation and reducing T-cell activation. Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, was approved for melanoma but has shown less efficacy in other cancers. "Ipilimumab, a human IgG1κ anti­CTLA4 mAb, gained FDA approval in 2011 for non­resectable stage III/IV melanoma following evi­ dence that it elicited potent tumour necrosis54 and conferred a 3.6­month short­term survival benefit55."
- **PD-1/PD-L1:** The PD-1 axis, involving PD-1 on T cells and its ligands PD-L1/PD-L2 on APCs and tumour cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation. Blockade of this pathway has shown broad clinical utility. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, anti-PD-1 antibodies, are approved for various cancers. "In 2014, the humanized and fully human anti­PD1 mAbs pembrolizumab and nivolumab (both IgG4) became the first FDA­approved PD1­targeted therapeutics for refractory and unresectable mela­ noma101–104."
- **T Cell Fates After Activation:** Following activation, circulating naive T cells have three major fates in the periphery: contraction through apoptosis, exhaustion phenotype, or long-term immunological memory.
- **Adoptive T Cell Therapy (ATC):** ATC involves isolating, expanding, and re-infusing tumour-specific T cells.
- **Tumour-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs):** TIL-based ATC has shown promise in melanoma.
- **Engineered Lymphocytes (CAR T cells):** Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) bypass MHC restriction, directing cytotoxicity to surface molecules on malignant cells. "Isolated T cells from the patient (or allogeneic donor) are genet­ ically modified to express CARs and then expanded and infused into the patient."
- **Cancer Vaccines:** Cancer vaccines aim to stimulate the immune system to protect the body from cancer.
- **Prophylactic Vaccines:** Protect against oncogenic viruses (e.g., hepatitis B, HPV).
- **Therapeutic Vaccines:** Eliminate existing neoplastic cells. An example is the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine for bladder cancer.
- **Personalized Recombinant Cancer Vaccines:** These vaccines target neoantigens unique to a patient's tumour, identified through next-generation sequencing. "Vaccines that elicit responses to tumour­derived neoantigens should induce more robust immune responses and cause fewer autoimmune­related toxic­ ities than vaccines based on self­derived TAAs".
- Design involves computer-based algorithms to identify tumour-derived peptides that could form a suitable TAA or tumour neoantigen with the patient’s MHC alleles.
- **Combining Immunotherapy with Other Treatments:** Combining radiation therapy with checkpoint blockade can be synergistic. Radiotherapy increases neoantigen exposure while checkpoint blockade prevents immune suppression.
- **Emerging Targets:** Research is focusing on new negative regulators of T-cell activation, including LAG-3, TIM-3, VISTA, B7-H3, and TIGIT. The blocking of immune checkpoint mol­ ecules releases potent antitumoural responses, and the stimulation of T cell co­stimulatory receptors can also amplify the effect of existing immunotherapies.
- **Toxicities:** Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are a significant concern with checkpoint inhibitors. These toxicities are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events severity scale.

**Implications:**

- Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology, offering durable survival benefits for some patients with previously fatal cancers.
- The field is rapidly evolving with the development of new targets, combination therapies, and personalized approaches.
- Understanding T-cell biology and regulation is crucial for optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies.
- Managing immune-related adverse events remains a critical challenge.

### Cancer Immunotherapy FAQ

- **What is cancer immunotherapy and how did it originate?**
- Cancer immunotherapy is a treatment approach that leverages the body's own immune system to fight cancer. The idea originated in the 19th century with observations of tumour regression following infections. William Coley, known as the 'Father of Cancer Immunotherapy', used heat-inactivated bacteria extracts ('Coley's toxins') to stimulate the immune system, achieving some success. However, due to a lack of scientific rigor and the rise of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, Coley's toxins were not widely adopted. The concept resurfaced in the 20th century with advances in immunology and technology, proving the ability of T cells to attack cancer tissue and revolutionising oncology.
- **What is the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis and what evidence supports it?**
- The cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis, independently conceived by Lewis Thomas and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, proposes that the immune system constantly identifies and eliminates nascent neoplastic cells, preventing carcinogenesis. This is similar to how the immune system rejects grafts. Evidence includes productive immune responses after tumour adoptive transfer in mice and spontaneous melanoma regression in patients with autoimmune diseases. Knockout mouse models, lacking specific immune components, also showed a link between immunodeficiency and cancer.
- **What are immune checkpoints and how are they relevant to cancer immunotherapy?**
- Immune checkpoints are mechanisms that inhibit immune cell activation, preventing hyperactivation and autoimmunity. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are two well-characterised immune checkpoint molecules. In cancer, these checkpoints can be exploited by tumour cells to evade immune destruction. Immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors block these checkpoints, unleashing the immune system's ability to attack cancer cells.
- **How do CTLA-4 and PD-1 function, and what are the key differences between them?**
- CTLA-4, structurally similar to the co-stimulatory molecule CD28, is induced upon T cell activation and constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs). It binds to B7-1 and B7-2 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), preventing CD28 co-stimulation and reducing T cell activation. It can also mediate the internalisation of B7 ligands. PD-1, expressed on T cells after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, binds to PDL1 and PDL2. It inhibits T cell activation through inhibitory intracellular signalling and can induce T cell exhaustion. CTLA-4 primarily acts in lymphoid organs, while PD-1 acts more in peripheral tissues. CTLA-4 affects T cell activation more broadly, while PD-1 is crucial for controlling continued effector T cell activation.
- **What are the main types of cancer immunotherapy and how do they work?**
- The main types of cancer immunotherapy include:
- **Checkpoint blockade:** Using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to block immune checkpoint molecules (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1), releasing the brakes on the immune system.
- **Adoptive cell transfer (ATC):** Harvesting and expanding a patient's own immune cells (often T cells), sometimes genetically modifying them, and then reinfusing them to attack the cancer. This includes tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), TCR-engineered lymphocytes, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells.
- **Cancer vaccines:** Stimulating the immune system to recognise and attack cancer cells. These can be prophylactic (preventative) or therapeutic. Therapeutic vaccines aim to eliminate existing cancer cells. Personalized vaccines, based on neoantigens unique to a patient's tumour, are a newer approach.
- **What are CAR T-cells and how are they engineered?**
- CAR T-cells are T cells that have been genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. CARs consist of an extracellular antigen-binding domain (often derived from an antibody) linked to intracellular signalling domains that activate the T cell. This allows the T cell to specifically target and kill cells expressing the antigen, bypassing the need for antigen presentation via MHC molecules. CAR T-cells are created by isolating T cells from a patient (or donor), genetically modifying them to express the CAR, expanding them _in vitro_, and infusing them back into the patient.
- **What are some of the toxicities associated with cancer immunotherapy, and how are they managed?**
- Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are a significant concern with cancer immunotherapy, arising from the unleashed immune response attacking healthy tissues. These toxicities can affect various organs and are graded by severity. Mild toxicities may not require treatment, while more severe events necessitate discontinuation of therapy and the use of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents. Active monitoring for symptoms and laboratory abnormalities is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.
- **What are some emerging targets and strategies in cancer immunotherapy?**
- Emerging targets include other immune checkpoint molecules such as LAG-3, TIM-3, VISTA, B7-H3, and TIGIT. Blocking these checkpoints, often in combination with existing therapies like PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, is being investigated. Additionally, stimulating T cell co-stimulatory receptors (e.g., ICOS, CD134, 4-1BB) is being explored to amplify immune responses. Combining immunotherapy with other treatments like radiation therapy is another promising area, as is development of personalised neoantigen vaccines.

## Quiz: Answer Key

1. Coley's toxins were extracts of heat-inactivated _S. pyogenes_ and _S. marcescens_ used to stimulate the immune system. They were discontinued due to a lack of scientific rigour and reproducibility, as well as the discovery of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
2. The "cancer immunosurveillance" hypothesis states that the immune system constantly identifies and eliminates newly arising neoplastic cells expressing tumour-associated neoantigens, preventing tumour development.
3. T cells are a type of lymphocyte that play a critical role in adaptive immunity. In cancer immunotherapy, they are essential for recognising and destroying cancer cells via antigen-directed cytotoxicity.
4. Immune checkpoints are mechanisms of immune cell inhibition that restrain excessive activation. They prevent autoimmunity and tissue damage, but can also limit anti-tumour immune responses.
5. CD4+ T cells detect antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules and orchestrate the adaptive immune response by producing cytokines. CD8+ T cells detect antigen in the context of MHC class I molecules and carry out direct cytotoxic reactions that kill infected or neoplastic cells.
6. CTLA4 competes with CD28 for binding to B7-1 and B7-2 ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), preventing co-stimulation. It also mediates internalisation of its ligands and recruits phosphatases, inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation.
7. PD1 restrains immune responses by inhibitory intracellular signalling in effector T cells and Tregs. When PD1 engages its ligands (PDL1/PDL2), it recruits phosphatases that dephosphorylate downstream effectors, leading to T cell exhaustion or apoptosis.
8. Tumour cells can upregulate PD1 ligands (PDL1/PDL2) on their surface, leading to T cell exhaustion and generating a tumour microenvironment that suppresses anti-tumour immunity, facilitating tumour growth and invasion.
9. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are immune cells that have migrated into a tumour. In ATC therapy, TILs are isolated from a cancer biopsy, expanded _ex vivo_, and then reinfused into the patient to enhance anti-tumour immunity.
10. Tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) are highly expressed on tumour cells and to a lesser extent on normal tissues, while tumour neoantigens are unique to a malignancy. As viral antigens and neoantigens that are unique to a malignancy are more likely to be recognised by the immune system than ‘self' TAAs, they are more suited as vaccine targets.
